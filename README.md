# arduino-rotary
Rotary encoder Arduino source code. Great example how to handle rotary encoders and buttons.

This is an example for rotary encoders and buttons in Arduino. It uses no library because I try to keep it short and simple. The example is using timer 0 to handle the timing. Any of the other timers can be used if timer 0 is already occupied.
